# Use this as a react-redux starter

This mini project contains below parts

1. A small react-redux app that starts with a single reducer
2. We then add another reducer and show how to combine multiple reducers
3. We add middleware to perform additional actions with redux 
4. We introduce async actions using redux-thunk and show how to fetch the data using api end-point

You can refer to each commit and look at how each part is done. Each commit is a feature or subfeature which will guide you right from the beginning. This can also be used as a quick starter reference (for setup and steps) while coding up the new react-redux project.
